            <h2>Progressive English: Beyond the Basics</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the "Progressive" section, where we delve deeper into nuances that make your English sound more natural and sophisticated. We've already covered the fundamentals of "have got" and "has got," understanding their role in expressing possession and obligation. Now, let's explore how these concepts evolve in everyday speech and how to apply them confidently in a corporate setting.</p>
            <p>Mastering these progressive elements will significantly enhance your fluency and allow you to communicate with greater ease and authenticity.</p>

            <h3>Even Shorter: The Power of 'Got'! ✨</h3>
            <p>You've mastered "have got" and "has got," but English, like any living language, is always evolving! In informal contexts, and even in some semi-formal situations, especially in rapid speech, it's common for **some speakers** to omit "have" or "has" and use just "got."</p>
            <p>This happens because "got" alone can convey the idea of possession or "having to do something" very directly. It's a linguistic shortcut that indicates a high level of immersion in the language!</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> While extremely common in spoken English, particularly in movies and songs, in very formal documents or serious presentations, it's generally safer to use the full form "have got" or the simple "have." However, for conversations, quick emails, or more casual interactions, "got" can be a powerful tool for sounding natural.</p>

            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>Example 1: Possession</h4>
                <p class="highlight-text">"I got a new phone."</p>
                <p>Meaning: "I have a new phone." (Instead of "I have got a new phone.")</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>Example 2: Obligation (with "to")</h4>
                <p class="highlight-text">"You got to be kidding me!"</p>
                <p>Meaning: "You have to be kidding me!" (Instead of "You have got to be kidding me!")</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Pop Culture Examples:</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>🎶 Song: "I Got a Feeling" (The Black Eyed Peas)</h4>
                <p>Yes, the same hit we saw before, but in the shorter version!</p>
                <p class="highlight-text">"I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night."</p>
                <p>Here, "I got" is the abbreviated and very common form of "I've got" or "I have got."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>🎬 Movie: "Guardians of the Galaxy"</h4>
                <p>Peter Quill (Star-Lord) often uses this relaxed form. For example, when referring to having something:</p>
                <p class="highlight-text">"I got a plan!"</p>
                <p>Meaning: "I have a plan!" (Instead of "I have got a plan!")</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>🎶 Song: "Got My Mind Set on You" (George Harrison)</h4>
                <p>The song title itself is a perfect example!</p>
                <p class="highlight-text">"I got my mind set on you."</p>
                <p>Meaning: "My mind is focused on you."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>🎬 Movie: "Jerry Maguire"</h4>
                <p>Rod Tidwell's famous line:</p>
                <p class="highlight-text">"Show me the money! You got to show me the money!"</p>
                <p>Here, "You got to" is the informal form of "You have got to" (You have to).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h4>Quick Everyday Examples:</h4>
                <p>These are very common in casual speech, used by some people for brevity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I got a meeting at 3." (Meaning: I have a meeting at 3.)</li>
                    <li>"You got a minute?" (Meaning: Do you have a minute?)</li>
                    <li>"She got a new car." (Meaning: She has a new car.)</li>
                    <li>"We got to finish this report." (Meaning: We have to finish this report.)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Final Tips for Confident Usage ✨</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Naturally:</strong> "Have got" is very common in informal and semi-formal conversations. In very formal documents or academic presentations, "to have" might be preferred.</li>
                <li><strong>Contraction is Key:</strong> Whenever possible, use contractions ("I've got," "She's got") to sound more fluent and native.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Aloud:</strong> Try forming your own sentences and scenarios. Speaking aloud helps internalize the structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen and Imitate:</strong> Pay attention to how native speakers use "have got" in movies, series, podcasts, and meetings. Try to imitate their intonation and rhythm.</li>
