            <h2>Variations of "Heads-Up" 🎭</h2>
            <p>Here are the most common natural variations of “heads-up” used in English (from formal to very casual). You can mix and match them depending on the situation and relationship:</p>

            <h3>1. Classic & Most Common ✨</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>Just a quick heads-up</li>
                <li>Just a heads-up</li>
                <li>Just to give you a quick heads-up</li>
                <li>Just wanted to give you a heads-up</li>
                <li>Quick heads-up</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="walkthrough-box">
                <h4>Walk-through: Classic Use Case 🚶‍♂️</h4>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You're about to send an email with important, but not urgent, information that might require a quick action from the recipient.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brazilian thought:</strong> "Vou mandar o e-mail com a informação." (I'll send the email with the information.)</p>
                <p><strong>Why "Just a heads-up" is better:</strong> It politely signals that the email contains information they should be aware of, without demanding immediate attention. It sets a considerate tone.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Subject: Just a quick heads-up on the Q4 budget proposal. The final version is attached for your review."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Slightly More Formal / Polite 🎩</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>Just a courtesy heads-up</li>
                <li>Wanted to flag this for you</li>
                <li>Thought you’d want a heads-up</li>
                <li>Just flagging this in advance</li>
                <li>A quick note in advance</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="walkthrough-box">
                <h4>Walk-through: Formal Notification 📝</h4>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You need to inform a senior colleague or client about a minor change in a project plan that might affect them, but you want to maintain a professional and respectful tone.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brazilian thought:</strong> "Preciso informar sobre a mudança no projeto." (I need to inform about the project change.)</p>
                <p><strong>Why "Wanted to flag this for you" is better:</strong> This phrasing is more formal and respectful, indicating that you consider their position and the importance of the information. It's less casual than "just a heads-up."</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Wanted to flag this for you: the project timeline has been adjusted by two days due to a vendor delay. We're working to mitigate the impact."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Casual / Friendly 👋</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>Heads up!</li>
                <li>FYI / For your info</li>
                <li>Quick FYI</li>
                <li>Just so you know…</li>
                <li>By the way… (BTW)</li>
                <li>Thought I’d let you know</li>
                <li>Fair warning…</li>
                <li>Little warning</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="walkthrough-box">
                <h4>Walk-through: Friendly Alert 💬</h4>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You're chatting with a close colleague on Slack and notice something they might find useful or amusing, but it's not work-critical.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brazilian thought:</strong> "Ah, e a propósito..." (Oh, and by the way...)</p>
                <p><strong>Why "Just so you know..." or "FYI" is better:</strong> These are perfect for quick, informal updates that don't require a formal response. They integrate smoothly into casual conversations, making your English feel more natural and less stiff.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Hey, just so you know, the new coffee machine arrived! ☕"</p>
            </div>

            <h3>4. Very Informal / Text/Slack Style 📱</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>h/u</li>
                <li>heyy quick heads up</li>
                <li>incoming!</li>
                <li>brace yourself lol</li>
                <li>small warning ⚠️</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="walkthrough-box">
                <h4>Walk-through: Ultra-Casual Heads-Up 🚀</h4>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You're sending a very quick text to a friend or a very close team member about something immediate and minor.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brazilian thought:</strong> "Aviso rápido!" (Quick warning!) ou "Chegando!" (Arriving!)</p>
                <p><strong>Why "h/u" or "incoming!" is better:</strong> These are highly contextual and only for very close relationships. Using them shows you're comfortable with modern, abbreviated English communication, similar to how Brazilians use slang or shortened phrases in texts. It adds a layer of authenticity to your casual English.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "h/u - running 5 late. be there soon!"</p>
            </div>

            <h3>5. Workplace Email Favorites 📧</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>Circling back with a quick heads-up</li>
                <li>Looping you in early</li>
                <li>Giving you a heads-up ahead of time</li>
                <li>Wanted to alert you in advance</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="walkthrough-box">
                <h4>Walk-through: Proactive Email Communication 📬</h4>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You're managing a project and foresee a potential issue or need to bring someone into a discussion before it becomes critical.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brazilian thought:</strong> "Estou te incluindo na conversa." (I'm including you in the conversation.) ou "Te avisando antes." (Notifying you beforehand.)</p>
                <p><strong>Why "Looping you in early" or "Giving you a heads-up ahead of time" is better:</strong> These phrases are excellent for proactive communication in professional emails. They demonstrate foresight and a desire to keep stakeholders informed, preventing surprises and fostering trust. They are more polished than a simple "I'm telling you."</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Subject: Looping you in early on the Q2 budget adjustments. There might be a slight impact on your department's allocation."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>6. One-Word or Super Short Alternatives 🎯</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>Note</li>
                <li>Ping</li>
                <li>Nudge</li>
                <li>Alert</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="walkthrough-box">
                <h4>Walk-through: Concise Reminders 🔔</h4>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You need to send a very brief, non-intrusive reminder or draw attention to something quickly, often in a chat or email subject line.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brazilian thought:</strong> "Lembrete!" (Reminder!) ou "Atenção!" (Attention!)</p>
                <p><strong>Why "Ping" or "Nudge" is better:</strong> These are highly efficient and common in fast-paced digital communication. "Ping" suggests a quick check-in, while "Nudge" implies a gentle reminder. They are less formal than "reminder" but still professional in many contexts.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Subject: Ping - Q1 Report Status" or "Nudge: Don't forget the team lunch today!"</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="examples-in-action">
            <h2>Examples in Action: Choosing Your Tone 🗣️</h2>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li><strong>Super casual:</strong> “Heads up – boss is in a mood today 😅”</li>
                <li><strong>Professional email:</strong> “Just a quick heads-up that the client call has been rescheduled to 4 PM.”</li>
                <li><strong>Text to friend:</strong> “Fair warning, I ate the last slice of pizza”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these basically mean the same thing: “I’m telling you this now so you’re not caught off guard.” Pick the one that matches your tone!</p>
