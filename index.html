            <h2>Understanding "Just to give you a heads up" 💡</h2>
            <p>
                "Just (to give you) a quick heads-up" is a casual, polite way to warn or inform someone about something in advance, usually when the news is small, unexpected, or could affect them. It's very common in workplaces, emails, chats, and conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
                It softens the message and shows consideration (“I’m telling you early so you’re not surprised”). Very natural in English-speaking workplaces and casual communication.

            <h3>Common Situations & Short Examples:</h3>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Something is changing soon</strong><br>
                    → "Just a quick heads-up — the meeting got moved to 3 PM instead of 2 PM."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Someone is about to be contacted</strong><br>
                    → "Hey, just a quick heads-up: Sarah from accounting will reach out to you about the invoice."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>A small problem or delay</strong><br>
                    → "Quick heads-up — the printer is out of toner, so reports might be delayed a bit."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>A visitor or call is coming</strong><br>
                    → "Just to give you a quick heads-up, the client is already in the lobby and heading up now."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reminding about a deadline</strong><br>
                    → "Quick heads-up: the proposal is due tomorrow morning!"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal / friendly context</strong><br>
                    → "Just a quick heads-up — I’m running 10 minutes late, sorry!"

            <h2>Walk-through Situations: From Brazilian Habits to Global English 🌍</h2>
            <p>Let's explore common communication scenarios where Brazilians might use a direct approach, and how "heads-up" offers a more nuanced, polite, and globally accepted alternative. Each situation highlights a typical Brazilian phrasing and then shows how "heads-up" elevates the communication.</p>

            <ol class="alpha-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Situation 1: Informing about a Schedule Change 🗓️</h3>
                    <p><strong>Typical Brazilian Approach:</strong> "A reunião mudou para as 15h." (The meeting changed to 3 PM.)</p>
                    <p>This is direct and factual, but can sometimes feel abrupt in an international context, especially if the change impacts others' plans without prior warning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elevated English with "Heads-Up":</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        "Just a quick heads-up, the team meeting has been rescheduled to 3 PM today. Please update your calendars. Apologies for any inconvenience."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why it's better:</strong> The "heads-up" softens the announcement, acknowledges the potential impact on others, and frames it as a helpful notification rather than just a statement of fact. It shows consideration and professionalism.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Situation 2: Delegating a Task 🤝</h3>
                    <p><strong>Typical Brazilian Approach:</strong> "O João vai te ligar sobre o projeto." (João will call you about the project.)</p>
                    <p>Again, very direct. The recipient might wonder why João is calling, what it's about, or if they should be prepared for something specific.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elevated English with "Heads-Up":</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        "Hey Maria, just a heads-up that João from the marketing team will be reaching out to you this afternoon regarding the new campaign brief. He'll need your input on the budget allocation."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why it's better:</strong> This "heads-up" provides context, purpose, and even a heads-up on what information will be needed. It prepares the recipient, making the subsequent interaction more efficient and less surprising.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Situation 3: Warning about a Potential Issue ⚠️</h3>
                    <p><strong>Typical Brazilian Approach:</strong> "O sistema está lento hoje." (The system is slow today.)</p>
                    <p>While true, this statement alone doesn't offer a solution or manage expectations. People might get frustrated without understanding the broader impact or what to expect.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elevated English with "Heads-Up":</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        "Quick heads-up, the system is experiencing some intermittent slowness today, especially with report generation. Our IT team is actively working on it, but you might experience delays. We'll send an update once it's resolved."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why it's better:</strong> This "heads-up" not only states the problem but also provides reassurance (IT is working on it), sets expectations for potential delays, and promises further communication. It manages anxiety and keeps everyone informed proactively.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Situation 4: Reminding a Colleague about a Deadline ⏰</h3>
                    <p><strong>Typical Brazilian Approach:</strong> "Você precisa entregar o relatório amanhã." (You need to submit the report tomorrow.)</p>
                    <p>This can sound demanding or accusatory, even if not intended. It might put the colleague on the defensive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elevated English with "Heads-Up":</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        "Just a friendly heads-up, the Q3 sales report is due tomorrow morning. Let me know if you need any assistance or if there are any blockers on your end."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why it's better:</strong> The "friendly heads-up" softens the reminder, making it collaborative rather than confrontational. It offers support and opens a dialogue, fostering a more positive working relationship.
                    </p>
